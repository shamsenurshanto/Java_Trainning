Threads:
In most modern programming,
parallel execution is achieved using threads.
A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be
managed independently by a scheduler (typically part of the operating system).

Challenges of Parallel Programming:

Synchronization and Data Races:

If multiple threads try to access and modify the same shared data at the same time, you can get unpredictable results (a "data race").

You need synchronization mechanisms (like locks, mutexes, semaphores) to ensure that only one thread modifies a critical piece of data at a time. This adds complexity.

Deadlock:

Imagine Thread A needs Resource 1 and Resource 2. Thread B needs Resource 2 and Resource 1.

If Thread A gets Resource 1 and Thread B gets Resource 2, they can both get stuck waiting for the other's resource. This is a deadlock.

Load Balancing:

Ensuring that all processors/threads have roughly an equal amount of work to do. If one thread finishes early, and others are still working, you're not maximizing your parallelism.

Complexity:

Designing, implementing, debugging, and testing parallel programs is significantly more complex than sequential ones. It's harder to reason about the exact state of the program at any given moment.
